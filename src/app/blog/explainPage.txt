1. type Props = { searchParams?: 
  { page?: string; 
    q?: string 
  } };

  1️⃣ What exactly is searchParams?

searchParams is not something you defined manually —
it is automatically provided by Next.js (starting from version 13+ when using the App Router). And we are using here because we will later do pagination in the page and search by catergory later.

page is the no of page 
q is the category

we can give other names like page no and category

This defines the shape of props that the BlogPage component will receive.

searchParams — represents query parameters from the URL, e.g.
/blog?page=2&q=health

? after searchParams means it’s optional — the page might be /blog (no query params).
The ? in /blog?page=2 isn’t from TypeScript — it’s just how query strings are written in URLs.

2. const page = Number(searchParams?.page ?? 1);
const q = searchParams?.q ?? undefined;


🔹 searchParams?.page ?? 1
The ?. (optional chaining) means “if searchParams exists, get page”.

The ?? (nullish coalescing operator) means “if the left side is null or undefined, use the right side”.

So:

If ?page=2, then page = Number("2") → 2

If no page in the URL, it defaults to 1.

This ensures your pagination always has a valid number.

🔹 searchParams?.q ?? undefined
Similar logic:

If ?q=wellness, then q = "wellness".

If there’s no q in the URL, it becomes undefined.


Fetching posts from the database
const data = await getPosts({ page, limit: 8, search: q, publishedOnly: true });


This line calls your database query function getPosts() with these parameters:

Parameter	Meaning
page	Current page number (for pagination)
limit: 8	Only fetch 8 posts per page
search: q	Optional keyword filter (if the user searched something)
publishedOnly: true	Fetch only published posts (not drafts)


Example:
If the user visits /blog?page=2&q=health,
it will run:

getPosts({ page: 2, limit: 8, search: "health", publishedOnly: true })

   {data.items.map((post: any) => (
          <BlogCard key={post.slug} post={post} />
        ))}

        explaining the syntaxs
        data is an object and that is why it has {}
        .map is a function so it will have () to show it is a function
        it is taking an input called post so should have ()unless it is an object. but cant use an object to map.
        then it is an arrow fn
